1.
The value of variable a will not change after called the function increment_int_a becuase the function is called as a call by
value. So, when the function is called a copy of variable a will be passed to function and the changes will be done to that 
copy which will not reflect to the original variable a.

2.
The value of element of list b will change after calling the function increment_int_b. as when a mutable object is passed to a 
function it is passed as a call by reference which means the value pass to the function will reference to the same location of 
original object hence changes made inside the function will also change the original object.

3.
They differ in answer because one is called by the function while the other is called by reference
